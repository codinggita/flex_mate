## Problem Statement:

Freelancer platforms often face challenges in maintaining a healthy relationship between freelancers and clients. Miscommunications, unclear expectations, delays in responses, and disputes over deliverables lead to dissatisfaction for both parties. Freelancers struggle to establish trust and professionalism, while clients face difficulty managing projects and ensuring timely deliveries.

## Solution:

The Freelancer Relationship Manager (FRM) is a web-based platform designed to streamline freelancer-client interactions. The FRM will include:

Dashboard for Communication: A centralized chat system with task tracking to ensure seamless and transparent communication.
Milestone Tracking: Breakdown of projects into deliverables with deadlines and automated reminders.
Feedback System: A two-way rating system to promote trust and professionalism.
Contract Templates: Predefined contract options to set expectations on timelines, deliverables, and payment terms.
Portfolio Integration: Freelancers can showcase their skills and work, making it easier for clients to evaluate their expertise.
